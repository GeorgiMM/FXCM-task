# FXCM-task
# To run the project:
Clone the master branch to your PC;
Import it as a maven project;
Run maven build of the project;
Run the project with Run configuration goal: clean verify;

# Notes and remarks:
* Item quantity is a div and it is not possible to add more than one item. The tests are simplified with one item per test.
* Did not find a good way to check if images on page are visible.
* Can not think of more complex scenarios on such simple site

* As I was busy durng the weekend and Monday evening, I did not have enough time to make the best I am capable of:
-- no good package and class management
-- some more logging of steps
